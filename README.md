## API Connection

GENOS connects to an n8n workflow API endpoint for AI responses. The webhook endpoint is:

https://my-automations.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/my-workflow
```

The interface sends user messages to this endpoint as JSON payloads and displays the responses in real-time in the chat interface. The API is expected to return responses in the format:
```json
{
    "text": "AI response text here"
}
```
